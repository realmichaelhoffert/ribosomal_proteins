16528	272847	TIGR00001	rpmI_bact	ribosomal protein L35. This ribosomal protein is found in bacteria and organelles only. It is not closely related to any eukaryotic or archaeal ribosomal protein. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	63
16529	272848	TIGR00002	S16	ribosomal protein S16. This model describes ribosomal S16 of bacteria and organelles. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	78
16536	272851	TIGR00009	L28	ribosomal protein L28. This model describes bacterial and chloroplast forms of the 50S ribosomal protein L28, a polypeptide about 60 amino acids in length. Mitochondrial homologs differ substantially in architecture (e.g. SP|P36525 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is 258 amino acids long) and are not included. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	56
16539	272854	TIGR00012	L29	ribosomal protein L29. This model describes a ribosomal large subunit protein, called L29 in prokaryotic (50S) large subunits and L35 in eukaryotic (60S) large subunits. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	55
16555	211539	TIGR00029	S20	ribosomal protein S20. This family consists of bacterial (and chloroplast) examples of the bacteria ribosomal small subunit protein S20. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	87
16556	129141	TIGR00030	S21p	ribosomal protein S21. This model describes bacterial ribosomal protein S21 and most mitochondrial and chloroplast equivalents. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	58
16584	272880	TIGR00059	L17	ribosomal protein L17. Eubacterial and mitochondrial. The mitochondrial form, from yeast, contains an additional 110 amino acids C-terminal to the region found by this model. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	111
16585	272881	TIGR00060	L18_bact	ribosomal protein L18, bacterial type. The archaeal and eukaryotic type rpL18 is not detectable under this model. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	114

16626	272907	TIGR00105	L31	ribosomal protein L31. This family consists exclusively of bacterial (and organellar) 50S ribosomal protein L31. In some species, such as Bacillus subtilis, this protein exists in two forms (RpmE and YtiA), one of which (RpmE) contains a pair of motifs, CXC and CXXC, for binding zinc. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	68
16676	129262	TIGR00158	L9	ribosomal protein L9. Ribosomal protein L9 appears to be universal in, but restricted to, eubacteria and chloroplast. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	148
16683	272937	TIGR00165	S18	ribosomal protein S18. This ribosomal small subunit protein is found in all eubacteria so far, as well as in chloroplasts. YER050C from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and a related protein from Caenorhabditis elegans appear to be homologous and may represent mitochondrial forms. The trusted cutoff is set high enough that these two candidate S18 proteins are not categorized automatically. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	70
16684	129270	TIGR00166	S6	ribosomal protein S6. The ribosomal protein S6 ortholog family, including yeast MRP17, shows more than two-fold length variation from 95 residues in Bacillus subtilis to 215 in Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This length variation comes primarily from poorly conserved C-terminal extensions that are particularly long in the Mycoplasmas. MRP17 protein is a component of the small ribosomal subunit in mitochondria, and is shown here to be an ortholog of S6. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	93
16794	129380	TIGR00279	uL16_euk_arch	ribosomal protein uL16(L10.e), eukarotic/archaeal form. This model finds the archaeal and eukaryotic forms of ribosomal protein uL16, previously L10.e. The protein is encoded by multiple loci in some eukaryotes and has been assigned a number of extra-ribosomal functions, some of which will require re-evaluation in the context of identification as a ribosomal protein. L10.e is distantly related to eubacterial ribosomal protein L16. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	172
16795	272996	TIGR00280	eL43_euk_arch	ribosomal protein eL43. This model finds eukaryotic ribosomal protein eL43 (previously L37a) and its archaeal orthologs. The nomeclature is tricky because eukaryotes have proteins called both L37 and L37a. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	92
16821	129407	TIGR00307	eS8	ribosomal protein eS8. Archaeal and eukaryotic ribosomal protein S8. This model could easily have been split into two models, one for eukaryotic S8 and one for archaeal S8; eukaryotic forms invariably have in insert of about 80 residues that archaeal forms of S8 do not. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	127
17213	273232	TIGR00717	rpsA	ribosomal protein S1. This model describes ribosomal protein S1, RpsA. This protein is found in most bacterial genomes in a single copy, but is not present in the Mycoplasmas. It is heterogeneous with respect to the number of repeats of the S1 RNA binding domain described by pfam00575: six repeats in E. coli and most other bacteria, four in Bacillus subtilis and some other species. rpsA is an essential gene in E. coli but not in B. subtilis. It is associated with the cytidylate kinase gene cmk in many species, and fused to it in Treponema pallidum. RpsA is proposed (Medline:97323001) to assist in mRNA degradation. This model provides trusted hits to most long form (6 repeat) examples of RpsA. Among homologs with only four repeats are some to which other (perhaps secondary) functions have been assigned. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	516
17227	273237	TIGR00731	bL25_bact_ctc	ribosomal protein bL25, Ctc-form. This model models a family of proteins with full-length homology to the general stress protein Ctc of Bacillus subtilis, a mesophile, and ribosomal protein TL5 of Thermus thermophilus, a thermophile. Ribosomal protein L25 of Escherichia coli and H. influenzae appear to be orthologous but consist only of the N-terminal half of Ctc and TL5. Both short (L25-like) and full-length (CTC-like) members of this family bind the E-loop of bacterial 5S rRNA. This protein appears to be restricted to bacteria and organelles, and consists of at most one copy per prokaryotic genome.Ctc of Bacillus subtilis has now been localized to ribosomes and can be viewed as the long form, or Ctc form, of L25. The C-terminal domain of sll1824, an apparent L25 of Synechocystis PCC6803, matches the N-terminal domain of this family. Examples of L25 and Ctc are not separated by a UPGMA tree built on the region of shared homology. [Protein synthesis, Ribosomal proteins: synthesis and modification]	176
17347	273301	TIGR00855	L12	ribosomal protein L7/L12. Ribosomal proteins L7 and L12 are synonymous except for post-translational modification of the N-terminal amino acid.

21116	411802	cd00105	KH-I	K homology (KH) RNA-binding domain, type I. KH binds single-stranded RNA or DNA. It is found in a wide variety of proteins including ribosomal proteins, transcription factors and post-transcriptional modifiers of mRNA. There are two different KH domains that belong to different protein folds, but they share a single KH motif. The KH motif is folded into a beta alpha alpha beta unit. In addition to the core, type II KH domains (e.g. ribosomal protein S3) include an N-terminal extension and type I KH domains (e.g. hnRNP K) contain a C-terminal extension. Some KH-I superfamily members contain a divergent KH domain that lacks the RNA-binding GXXG motif. Some others have a mutated GXXG motif which may or may not have nucleic acid binding ability.	63
21311	238196	cd00319	Ribosomal_S12_like	Ribosomal protein S12-like family; composed of  prokaryotic 30S ribosomal protein S12, eukaryotic 40S ribosomal protein S23 and similar proteins. S12 and S23 are located at the interface of the large and small ribosomal subunits, adjacent to the decoding center. They play an important role in translocation during the peptide elongation step of protein synthesis. They are also involved in important RNA and protein interactions. Ribosomal protein S12 is essential for maintenance of a pretranslocation state and, together with S13, functions as a control element for the rRNA- and tRNA-driven movements of translocation. S23 interacts with domain III of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which catalyzes translocation. Mutations in S12 and S23 have been found to affect translational accuracy. Antibiotics such as streptomycin may also bind S12/S23 and cause the ribosome to misread the genetic code.	95
21315	271245	cd00323	uS7	Ribosomal protein S7. uS7, also known as Ribosomal protein (RP)S7, is an important part of the translation process which is universally present in the small subunit of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. The ribosome small subunit is one of the two subunits of ribosome organelles that use mRNA as a template for protein synthesis in a process called translation. The small subunits of bacteria and eukaryotes have the same shape of head, body, platform, beak, and shoulder. RPS7 is located at the head of the small subunit. RPS7 is a primary ribosomal RNA (rRNA) binding protein that assists in rRNA folding and the binding of other proteins during small subunit assembly in all species. RPS7 is also involved in the formation of the mRNA exit channel at the interface of the large and small subunits. Some ribosomal proteins have extra ribosomal functions in cell differentiation and apoptosis.	130
21325	238205	cd00336	Ribosomal_L22	Ribosomal protein L22/L17e.  L22 (L17 in eukaryotes) is a core protein of the large ribosomal subunit.  It is the only ribosomal protein that interacts with all six domains of 23S rRNA, and is one of the proteins important for directing the proper folding and stabilizing the conformation of 23S rRNA.  L22 is the largest protein contributor to the surface of the polypeptide exit channel, the tunnel through which the polypeptide product passes.  L22 is also one of six proteins located at the putative translocon binding site on the exterior surface of the ribosome.	105
21331	100101	cd00349	Ribosomal_L11	"Ribosomal protein L11. Ribosomal protein L11, together with proteins L10 and L7/L12, and 23S rRNA, form the L7/L12 stalk on the surface of the large subunit of the ribosome. The homologous eukaryotic cytoplasmic protein is also called 60S ribosomal protein L12, which is distinct from the L12 involved in the formation of the L7/L12 stalk. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of L11 is essential for binding 23S rRNA, while the N-terminal domain (NTD) contains the binding site for the antibiotics thiostrepton and micrococcin. L11 and 23S rRNA form an essential part of the GTPase-associated region (GAR). Based on differences in the relative positions of the L11 NTD and CTD during the translational cycle, L11 is proposed to play a significant role in the binding of initiation factors, elongation factors, and release factors to the ribosome. Several factors, including the class I release factors RF1 and RF2, are known to interact directly with L11. In eukaryotes, L11 has been implicated in regulating the levels of ubiquinated p53 and MDM2 in the MDM2-p53 feedback loop, which is responsible for apoptosis in response to DNA damage. In bacteria, the ""stringent response"" to harsh conditions allows bacteria to survive, and ribosomes that lack L11 are deficient in stringent factor stimulation."	131
21335	238213	cd00353	Ribosomal_S15p_S13e	Ribosomal protein S15 (prokaryotic)_S13 (eukaryotic) binds the central domain of 16S rRNA and is required for assembly of the small ribosomal subunit and for intersubunit association, thus representing a key element in the assembly of the whole ribosome. S15 also plays an important autoregulatory role by binding and preventing its own mRNA from being translated. S15 has a predominantly alpha-helical fold that is highly structured except for the N-terminal alpha helix.	80
21337	100098	cd00355	Ribosomal_L30_like	Ribosomal protein L30, which is found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes but not in archaea, is one of the smallest ribosomal proteins with a molecular mass of about 7kDa. L30 binds the 23SrRNA as well as the 5S rRNA and is one of five ribosomal proteins that mediate the interactions 5S rRNA makes with the ribosome.  The eukaryotic L30 members have N- and/or C-terminal extensions not found in their prokaryotic orthologs.  L30 is closely related to the ribosomal L7 protein found in eukaryotes and archaea.	53
21349	238222	cd00379	Ribosomal_L10_P0	Ribosomal protein L10 family; composed of the large subunit ribosomal protein called L10 in bacteria, P0 in eukaryotes, and L10e in archaea, as well as uncharacterized P0-like eukaryotic proteins. In all three kingdoms, L10 forms a tight complex with multiple copies of the small acidic protein L12(e). This complex forms a stalk structure on the large subunit of the ribosome. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of L10 interacts with L11 protein and forms the base of the L7/L12 stalk, while the extended C-terminal helix binds to two or three dimers of the NTD of L7/L12 (L7 and L12 are identical except for an acetylated N-terminus). The L7/L12 stalk is known to contain the binding site for elongation factors G and Tu (EF-G and EF-Tu, respectively); however, there is disagreement as to whether or not L10 is involved in forming the binding site. The stalk is believed to be associated with GTPase activities in protein synthesis. In a neuroblastoma cell line, L10 has been shown to interact with the SH3 domain of Src and to activate the binding of the Nck1 adaptor protein with skeletal proteins such as the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) and the WASP-interacting protein (WIP). Some eukaryotic P0 sequences have an additional C-terminal domain homologous with acidic proteins P1 and P2.	155
21357	100102	cd00387	Ribosomal_L7_L12	Ribosomal protein L7/L12. Ribosomal protein L7/L12 refers to the large ribosomal subunit proteins L7 and L12, which are identical except that L7 is acetylated at the N terminus. It is a component of the L7/L12 stalk, which is located at the surface of the ribosome. The stalk base consists of a portion of the 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L11 and L10. An extended C-terminal helix of L10 provides the binding site for L7/L12. L7/L12 consists of two domains joined by a flexible hinge, with the helical N-terminal domain (NTD) forming pairs of homodimers that bind to the extended helix of L10. It is the only multimeric ribosomal component, with either four or six copies per ribosome that occur as two or three dimers bound to the L10 helix. L7/L12 is the only ribosomal protein that does not interact directly with rRNA, but instead has indirect interactions through L10. The globular C-terminal domains of L7/L12 are highly mobile. They are exposed to the cytoplasm and contain binding sites for other molecules. Initiation factors, elongation factors, and release factors are known to interact with the L7/L12 stalk during their GTP-dependent cycles. The binding site for the factors EF-Tu and EF-G comprises L7/L12, L10, L11, the L11-binding region of 23S rRNA, and the sarcin-ricin loop of 23S rRNA. Removal of L7/L12 has minimal effect on factor binding and it has been proposed that L7/L12 induces the catalytically active conformation of EF-Tu and EF-G, thereby stimulating the GTPase activity of both factors. In eukaryotes, the proteins that perform the equivalent function to L7/L12 are called P1 and P2, which do not share sequence similarity with L7/L12. However, a bacterial L7/L12 homolog is found in some eukaryotes, in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In archaea, the protein equivalent to L7/L12 is called aL12 or L12p, but it is closer in sequence to P1 and P2 than to L7/L12.	127
21360	238230	cd00392	Ribosomal_L13	Ribosomal protein L13.  Protein L13, a large ribosomal subunit protein, is one of five proteins required for an early folding intermediate of 23S rRNA in the assembly of the large subunit. L13 is situated on the bottom of the large subunit, near the polypeptide exit site.  It interacts with proteins L3 and L6, and forms an extensive network of interactions with 23S rRNA. L13 has been identified as a homolog of the human breast basic conserved protein 1 (BBC1), a protein identified through its increased expression in breast cancer.  L13 expression is also upregulated in a variety of human gastrointestinal cancers, suggesting it may play a role in the etiology of a variety of human malignancies.	114
21370	238235	cd00403	Ribosomal_L1	Ribosomal protein L1.  The L1 protein, located near the E-site of the ribosome, forms part of the L1 stalk along with 23S rRNA.  In bacteria and archaea, L1 functions both as a ribosomal protein that binds rRNA, and as a translation repressor that binds its own mRNA.  Like several other large ribosomal subunit proteins, L1 displays RNA chaperone activity.  L1 is one of the largest ribosomal proteins. It is composed of two domains that cycle between open and closed conformations via a hinge motion. The RNA-binding site of L1 is highly conserved, with both mRNA and rRNA binding the same binding site.	208
21387	238246	cd00432	Ribosomal_L18_L5e	Ribosomal L18/L5e:  L18 (L5e) is a ribosomal protein found in the central protuberance (CP) of the large subunit. L18 binds 5S rRNA and induces a conformational change that stimulates the binding of L5 to 5S rRNA. Association of 5S rRNA with 23S rRNA depends on the binding of L18 and L5 to 5S rRNA. L18/L5e is generally described as L18 in prokaryotes and archaea, and as L5e (or L5) in eukaryotes. In bacteria, the CP proteins L5, L18, and L25 are required for the ribosome to incorporate 5S rRNA into the large subunit, one of the last steps in ribosome assembly. In archaea, both L18 and L5 bind 5S rRNA; in eukaryotes, only the L18 homolog (L5e) binds 5S rRNA but a homolog to L5 is also identified.	103
21409	199209	cd00463	Ribosomal_L31e	Eukaryotic/archaeal ribosomal protein L31. Ribosomal protein L31e, which is present in archaea and eukaryotes, binds the 23S rRNA and is one of six protein components encircling the polypeptide exit tunnel. It is a component of the eukaryotic 60S (large) ribosomal subunit, and the archaeal 50S (large) ribosomal subunit.	83
21415	100103	cd00472	Ribosomal_L24e_L24	Ribosomal protein L24e/L24 is a ribosomal protein found in eukaryotes (L24) and in archaea (L24e, distinct from archaeal L24). L24e/L24 is located on the surface of the large subunit, adjacent to proteins L14 and L3, and near the translation factor binding site.  L24e/L24 appears to play a role in the kinetics of peptide synthesis, and may be involved in interactions between the large and small subunits, either directly or through other factors. In mouse, a deletion mutation in L24 has been identified as the cause for the belly spot and tail (Bst) mutation that results in disrupted pigmentation, somitogenesis and retinal cell fate determination.  L24 may be an important protein in eukaryotic reproduction:  in shrimp, L24 expression is elevated in the ovary, suggesting a role in oogenesis, and in Arabidopsis, L24 has been proposed to have a specific function in gynoecium development. No protein with sequence or structural homology to L24e/L24 has been identified in bacteria, but a functionally equivalent protein may exist.  Bacterial L19 forms an interprotein beta sheet with L14 that is similar to the L24e/L14 interprotein beta sheet observed in the archaeal L24e structures. Some eukaryotic L24 proteins were initially identified as L30, and this alignment model contains several sequences called L30.	54
21416	275385	cd00473	bS6	Bacterial ribosomal protein S6. bS6 is one of the components of the small subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome, a ribonucleoprotein organelle that decodes the genetic information in messenger RNA and forms peptide bonds to synthesize the corresponding polypeptides. Ribosomes consist of a large and a small subunit, which assemble during the initiation stage of protein synthesis. Prokaryotic ribosomes consist of three molecules of RNA and more than 50 proteins. The small subunits of bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes have the same overall shapes (with structural elements described as head, body, platform, beak and shoulder). The bacterial ribosomal protein S6 is important for the assembly of the central domain of the small subunit via heterodimerization with ribosomal protein S18.	91
21422	238268	cd00481	Ribosomal_L19e	Ribosomal protein L19e.  L19e is found in the large ribosomal subunit of eukaryotes and archaea. L19e is distinct from the ribosomal subunit L19, which is found in prokaryotes. It consists of two small globular domains connected by an extended segment. It is located toward the surface of the large subunit, with one exposed end involved in forming the intersubunit bridge with the small subunit.  The other exposed end is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e subunits.	145
22146	238705	cd01417	Ribosomal_L19e_E	Ribosomal protein L19e, eukaryotic.  L19e is found in the large ribosomal subunit of eukaryotes and archaea.

The other exposed end is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e subunits.	164
22147	238706	cd01418	Ribosomal_L19e_A	Ribosomal protein L19e, archaeal.  L19e is found in the large ribosomal subunit of eukaryotes and archaea. L19e is distinct from the ribosomal subunit L19, which is found in prokaryotes. It consists of two small globular domains connected by an extended segment. It is located toward the surface of the large subunit, with one exposed end involved in forming the intersubunit bridge with the small subunit.  The other exposed end is involved in forming the translocon binding site, along with L22, L23, L24, L29, and L31e subunits.	145
22154	100106	cd01425	RPS2	Ribosomal protein S2 (RPS2), involved in formation of the translation initiation complex, where it might contact the messenger RNA and several components of the ribosome. It has been shown that in Escherichia coli RPS2 is essential for the binding of ribosomal protein S1 to the 30s ribosomal subunit. In humans, most likely in all vertebrates, and perhaps in all metazoans, the protein also functions as the 67 kDa laminin receptor (LAMR1 or 67LR), which is formed from a 37 kDa precursor, and is overexpressed in many tumors. 67LR is a cell surface receptor which interacts with a variety of ligands, laminin-1 and others. It is assumed that the ligand interactions are mediated via the conserved C-terminus, which becomes extracellular as the protein undergoes conformational changes which are not well understood. Specifically, a conserved palindromic motif, LMWWML, may participate in the interactions. 67LR plays essential roles in the adhesion of cells to the basement membrane and subsequent signalling events, and has been linked to several diseases. Some evidence also suggests that the precursor of 67LR, 37LRP is also present in the nucleus in animals, where it appears associated with histones.	193
22320	100099	cd01657	Ribosomal_L7_archeal_euk	Ribosomal protein L7, which is found in archaea and eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes, binds domain II of the 23S rRNA as well as the 5S rRNA and is one of five ribosomal proteins that mediate the interactions 5S rRNA makes with the ribosome.  The eukaryotic L7 members have an N-terminal extension not found in the archeal L7 orthologs.  L7 is closely related to the ribosomal L30 protein found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes.	159
22321	100100	cd01658	Ribosomal_L30	Ribosomal protein L30, which is found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes but not in archaea, is one of the smallest ribosomal proteins with a molecular mass of about 7kDa. L30 binds the 23SrRNA as well as the 5S rRNA and is one of five ribosomal proteins that mediate the interactions 5S rRNA makes with the ribosome.  The eukaryotic L30 members have N- and/or C-terminal extensions not found in their prokaryotic orthologs.  L30 is closely related to the ribosomal L7 protein found in eukaryotes and archaea.	54
22839	411782	cd02411	KH-II_30S_S3_arch	type II K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain found in archaeal 30S ribosomal protein S3 and similar proteins. 30S ribosomal protein S3, also called small ribosomal subunit protein uS3, is part of the head region of the 30S ribosomal subunit and binds to the lower part of the 30S subunit head. It is believed to interact with mRNA as it threads its way from the latch into the channel. Members of this family are mainly from archaea and contain only one canonical type II K-homology (KH) domain that has the signature motif GXXG (where X represents any amino acid).	87
22840	411783	cd02412	KH-II_30S_S3	type II K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain found in 30S ribosomal protein S3 and similar proteins. 30S ribosomal protein S3, also called small ribosomal subunit protein uS3, is part of the head region of the 30S ribosomal subunit and binds to the lower part of the 30S subunit head. It may also bind mRNA in the 70S ribosome, positioning it for translation. S3 protein is believed to interact with mRNA as it threads its way from the latch into the channel. Members of this family contain only one canonical type II K-homology (KH) domain that has the signature motif GXXG (where X represents any amino acid).	108
22841	411784	cd02413	KH-II_40S_S3	type II K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain found in 40S ribosomal protein S3 and similar proteins. 40S ribosomal protein S3, also called small ribosomal subunit protein uS3, is part of the head region of the 40S ribosomal subunit and is involved in translation. It is believed to interact with mRNA as it threads its way from the latch into the channel. 40S ribosomal protein S3 has endonuclease activity and plays a role in repair of damaged DNA. It cleaves phosphodiester bonds of DNAs containing altered bases with broad specificity and cleaves supercoiled DNA more efficiently than relaxed DNA. Members of this family are mainly from prokaryotes and contain only one canonical type II K-homology (KH) domain that has the signature motif GXXG (where X represents any amino acid).	91
23502	239465	cd03367	Ribosomal_S23	S12-like family, 40S ribosomal protein S23 subfamily; S23 is located at the interface of the large and small ribosomal subunits of eukaryotes, adjacent to the decoding center. It interacts with domain III of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), which catalyzes the translocation of the growing peptidyl-tRNA to the P site to make room for the next aminoacyl-tRNA at the A (acceptor) site. Through its interaction with eEF2, S23 may play an important role in translocation. Also members of this subfamily are the archaeal 30S ribosomal S12 proteins. Prokaryotic S12 is essential for maintenance of a pretranslocation state and, together with S13, functions as control element for the rRNA- and tRNA-driven movements of translocation. S12 and S23 are also implicated in translation accuracy. Antibiotics such as streptomycin bind S12/S23 and cause the ribosome to misread the genetic code.	115
23503	239466	cd03368	Ribosomal_S12	S12-like family, 30S ribosomal protein S12 subfamily; S12 is located at the interface of the large and small ribosomal subunits of prokaryotes, chloroplasts and mitochondria, where it plays an important role in both tRNA and ribosomal subunit interactions. S12 is essential for maintenance of a pretranslocation state and, together with S13, functions as a control element for the rRNA- and tRNA-driven movements of translocation. Antibiotics such as streptomycin bind S12 and cause the ribosome to misread the genetic code.	108
24205	100108	cd04411	Ribosomal_P1_P2_L12p	Ribosomal protein P1, P2, and L12p. Ribosomal proteins P1 and P2 are the eukaryotic proteins that are functionally equivalent to bacterial L7/L12. L12p is the archaeal homolog. Unlike other ribosomal proteins, the archaeal L12p and eukaryotic P1 and P2 do not share sequence similarity with their bacterial counterparts. They are part of the ribosomal stalk (called the L7/L12 stalk in bacteria), along with 28S rRNA and the proteins L11 and P0 in eukaryotes (23S rRNA, L11, and L10e in archaea). In bacterial ribosomes, L7/L12 homodimers bind the extended C-terminal helix of L10 to anchor the L7/L12 molecules to the ribosome. Eukaryotic P1/P2 heterodimers and archaeal L12p homodimers are believed to bind the L10 equivalent proteins, eukaryotic P0 and archaeal L10e, in a similar fashion. P1 and P2 (L12p, L7/L12) are the only proteins in the ribosome to occur as multimers, always appearing as sets of dimers. Recent data indicate that most archaeal species contain six copies of L12p (three homodimers), while eukaryotes have two copies each of P1 and P2 (two heterodimers). Bacteria may have four or six copies (two or three homodimers), depending on the species. As in bacteria, the stalk is crucial for binding of initiation, elongation, and release factors in eukaryotes and archaea.	105

RPS1 is a component of the small ribosomal subunit thought to be involved in the recognition and binding of mRNA's during translation initiation. The bacterial RPS1 domain architecture consists of 4-6 tandem S1 domains. In some bacteria, the tandem S1 array is located C-terminal to a 4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase (HMBPP reductase) domain.While RPS1 is found primarily in bacteria, proteins with tandem RPS1-like domains have been identified in plants and humans, however these lack the N-terminal HMBPP reductase domain. This CD includes S1 repeat 2 of the Escherichia coli and Homo sapiens RPS1 (ec2 and hs2, respectively). Autoantibodies to double-stranded DNA from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus cross-react with the human RPS1 homolog.	67
24344	240019	cd04661	MRP_L46	Mitochondrial ribosomal protein L46 (MRP L46) is a component of the large subunit (39S) of the mammalian mitochondrial ribosome and a member of the Nudix hydrolase superfamily. MRPs are thought to be involved in the maintenance of the mitochondrial DNA. In general, members of the Nudix superfamily require a divalent cation, such as Mg2+ or Mn2+, for activity and contain the Nudix motif, a highly conserved 23-residue block (GX5EX7REUXEEXGU, where U = I, L or V), which functions as a metal binding and catalytic site. MRP L46 appears to contain a modified nudix motif.	132

25221	240221	cd05795	Ribosomal_P0_L10e	Ribosomal protein L10 family, P0 and L10e subfamily; composed of eukaryotic 60S ribosomal protein P0 and the archaeal P0 homolog, L10e. P0 or L10e forms a tight complex with multiple copies of the small acidic protein L12(e). This complex forms a stalk structure on the large subunit of the ribosome. The stalk is known to contain the binding site for elongation factors G and Tu (EF-G and EF-Tu, respectively); however, there is disagreement as to whether or not L10 is involved in forming the binding site. The stalk is believed to be associated with GTPase activities in protein synthesis. In a neuroblastoma cell line, L10 has been shown to interact with the SH3 domain of Src and to activate the binding of the Nck1 adaptor protein with skeletal proteins such as the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) and the WASP-interacting protein (WIP).

L10 occupies the L7/L12 stalk of the ribosome. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of L10 interacts with L11 protein and forms the base of the L7/L12 stalk, while the extended C-terminal helix binds to two or three dimers of the NTD of L7/L12 (L7 and L12 are identical except for an acetylated N-terminus). The L7/L12 stalk is known to contain the binding site for elongation factors G and Tu (EF-G and EF-Tu, respectively); however, there is disagreement as to whether or not L10 is involved in forming the binding site.

25255	100109	cd05831	Ribosomal_P1	Ribosomal protein P1. This subfamily represents the eukaryotic large ribosomal protein P1. Eukaryotic P1 and P2 are functionally equivalent to the bacterial protein L7/L12, but are not homologous to L7/L12. P1 is located in the L12 stalk, with proteins P2, P0, L11, and 28S rRNA. P1 and P2 are the only proteins in the ribosome to occur as multimers, always appearing as sets of heterodimers. Recent data indicate that eukaryotes have four copies (two heterodimers), while most archaeal species contain six copies of L12p (three homodimers) and bacteria may have four or six copies (two or three homodimers), depending on the species. Experiments using S. cerevisiae P1 and P2 indicate that P1 proteins are positioned more internally with limited reactivity in the C-terminal domains, while P2 proteins seem to be more externally located and are more likely to interact with other cellular components. In lower eukaryotes, P1 and P2 are further subdivided into P1A, P1B, P2A, and P2B, which form P1A/P2B and P1B/P2A heterodimers. Some plant species have a third P-protein, called P3, which is not homologous to P1 and P2. In humans, P1 and P2 are strongly autoimmunogenic. They play a significant role in the etiology and pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythema (SLE). In addition, the ribosome-inactivating protein trichosanthin (TCS) interacts with human P0, P1, and P2, with its primary binding site located in the C-terminal region of P2. TCS inactivates the ribosome by depurinating a specific adenine in the sarcin-ricin loop of 28S rRNA.	103

This subfamily includes archaeal L12p, the protein that is functionally equivalent to L7/L12 in bacteria and the P1 and P2 proteins in eukaryotes. L12p is homologous to P1 and P2 but is not homologous to bacterial L7/L12. It is located in the L12 stalk, with proteins L10, L11, and 23S rRNA. L12p is the only protein in the ribosome to occur as multimers, always appearing as sets of dimers. Recent data indicate that most archaeal species contain six copies of L12p (three homodimers), while eukaryotes have four copies (two heterodimers), and bacteria may have four or six copies (two or three homodimers), depending on the species. The organization of proteins within the stalk has been characterized primarily in bacteria, where L7/L12 forms either two or three homodimers and each homodimer binds to the extended C-terminal helix of L10. L7/L12 is attached to the ribosome through L10 and is the only ribosomal protein that does not directly interact with rRNA. Archaeal L12p is believed to function in a similar fashion. However, hybrid ribosomes containing the large subunit from E. coli with an archaeal stalk are able to bind archaeal and eukaryotic elongation factors but not bacterial elongation factors. In several mesophilic and thermophilic archaeal species, the binding of 23S rRNA to protein L11 and to the L10/L12p pentameric complex was found to be temperature-dependent and cooperative.	106

Mitochondrial and chloroplastic ribosomes are similar to bacterial ribosomes. Ribosomes consist of a large and a small subunit, which assemble during the initiation stage of protein synthesis. Prokaryotic ribosomes consist of three molecules of RNA and more than 50 proteins. The small subunits of bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomes have the same overall shapes (with structural elements described as head, body, platform, beak and shoulder). The bacterial ribosomal protein S6 is important for the assembly of the central domain of the small subunit via heterodimerization with ribosomal protein S18.	0

The MRPs are imported into mitochondria where they assemble coordinately with mitochondrially transcribed rRNAs into ribosomes that are responsible for translating the 13 mRNAs for essential proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation system. MRP-S23 is significantly up-regulated in uterine cancer cells.	0

43026	421862	cl29562	Ribosomal_L7_L12	N/A. Ribosomal protein L7/L12. Ribosomal protein L7/L12 refers to the large ribosomal subunit proteins L7 and L12, which are identical except that L7 is acetylated at the N terminus. It is a component of the L7/L12 stalk, which is located at the surface of the ribosome. The stalk base consists of a portion of the 23S rRNA and ribosomal proteins L11 and L10. An extended C-terminal helix of L10 provides the binding site for L7/L12. L7/L12 consists of two domains joined by a flexible hinge, with the helical N-terminal domain (NTD) forming pairs of homodimers that bind to the extended helix of L10. It is the only multimeric ribosomal component, with either four or six copies per ribosome that occur as two or three dimers bound to the L10 helix. L7/L12 is the only ribosomal protein that does not interact directly with rRNA, but instead has indirect interactions through L10. The globular C-terminal domains of L7/L12 are highly mobile. They are exposed to the cytoplasm and contain binding sites for other molecules. Initiation factors, elongation factors, and release factors are known to interact with the L7/L12 stalk during their GTP-dependent cycles. The binding site for the factors EF-Tu and EF-G comprises L7/L12, L10, L11, the L11-binding region of 23S rRNA, and the sarcin-ricin loop of 23S rRNA. Removal of L7/L12 has minimal effect on factor binding and it has been proposed that L7/L12 induces the catalytically active conformation of EF-Tu and EF-G, thereby stimulating the GTPase activity of both factors. In eukaryotes, the proteins that perform the equivalent function to L7/L12 are called P1 and P2, which do not share sequence similarity with L7/L12. However, a bacterial L7/L12 homolog is found in some eukaryotes, in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In archaea, the protein equivalent to L7/L12 is called aL12 or L12p, but it is closer in sequence to P1 and P2 than to L7/L12.	0

The S4 domain probably mediates binding to RNA.	48
45052	396259	pfam01599	Ribosomal_S27	Ribosomal protein S27a. This family of ribosomal proteins consists mainly of the 40S ribosomal protein S27a which is synthesized as a C-terminal extension of ubiquitin (CEP). The S27a domain compromises the C-terminal half of the protein. The synthesis of ribosomal proteins as extensions of ubiquitin promotes their incorporation into nascent ribosomes by a transient metabolic stabilisation and is required for efficient ribosome biogenesis. The ribosomal extension protein S27a contains a basic region that is proposed to form a zinc finger; its fusion gene is proposed as a mechanism to maintain a fixed ratio between ubiquitin necessary for degrading proteins and ribosomes a source of proteins.	43

49962	369158	pfam06984	MRP-L47	Mitochondrial 39-S ribosomal protein L47 (MRP-L47). This family represents the N-terminal region (approximately 8 residues) of the eukaryotic mitochondrial 39-S ribosomal protein L47 (MRP-L47). Mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) are the counterparts of the cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins, in that they fulfil similar functions in protein biosynthesis. However, they are distinct in number, features and primary structure.	86
50106	399848	pfam07147	PDCD9	Mitochondrial 28S ribosomal protein S30 (PDCD9). This family consists of several eukaryotic mitochondrial 28S ribosomal protein S30 (or programmed cell death protein 9 PDCD9) sequences. The exact function of this family is unknown although it is known to be a component of the mitochondrial ribosome and a component in cellular apoptotic signaling pathways.	441
51037	311863	pfam08136	Ribosomal_S22	30S ribosomal protein subunit S22 family. This family consists of the 30S ribosomal proteins subunit S22 polypeptides. This polypeptide is 47 amino acids in length and has a molecular weight of about 5 kDa. The S22 subunit is a component of the stationary-phase-specific ribosomal protein and is assembled in the ribosomal particles in the stationary phase. This subunit along with other stationary-phase-specific ribosomal proteins result in compositional changes of ribosomes during the stationary phase. The significance of this change is not clear as yet.	44

The 54S subunit contains at least 45 different proteins and 1 molecule of RNA (21S).	157
52839	401865	pfam10037	MRP-S27	Mitochondrial 28S ribosomal protein S27. Members of this family of small ribosomal proteins possess one of three conserved blocks of sequence found in proteins that stimulate the dissociation of guanine nucleotides from G-proteins, leaving open the possibility that MRP-S27 might be a functional partner of GTP-binding ribosomal proteins.	391
52999	402008	pfam10210	MRP-S32	Mitochondrial 28S ribosomal protein S32. This entry is of a family of short, approximately 100 amino acid residues, proteins which are mitochondrial 28S ribosomal proteins named as MRP-S32. Their exact function could not be confirmed.	92
53032	402036	pfam10245	MRP-S22	Mitochondrial 28S ribosomal protein S22. This is the conserved N-terminus and central portion of the mitochondrial small subunit 28S ribosomal protein S22. Mammalian mitochondria carry out the synthesis of 13 polypeptides that are essential for oxidative phosphorylation and, hence, for the synthesis of the majority of the ATP used by eukaryotic organisms. The number of proteins produced by prokaryotes is smaller, reflected in the lower number of ribosomal proteins present in them.	241
53033	402037	pfam10246	MRP-S35	Mitochondrial ribosomal protein MRP-S35. This is a family of short mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, less than 200 amino acids long. that are highly conserved from worms to humans. The structure has previously been referred to as MRP-S18 but the current numbering fits the preferred nomenclature from these authors.	105
53257	402213	pfam10484	MRP-S23	Mitochondrial ribosomal protein S23. MRP-S23 is one of the proteins that makes up the 55S ribosome in eukaryotes from nematodes to humans. It does not appear to carry any common motifs, either RNA binding or ribosomal protein motifs. All of the mammalian MRPs are encoded in nuclear genes that are evolving more rapidly than those encoding cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins. The MRPs are imported into mitochondria where they assemble coordinately with mitochondrially transcribed rRNAs into ribosomes that are responsible for translating the 13 mRNAs for essential proteins of the oxidative phosphorylation system. MRP-S23 is significantly up-regulated in uterine cancer cells.	124
53271	402226	pfam10501	Ribosomal_L50	Ribosomal subunit 39S. The 39S ribosomal protein appears to be a subunit of one of the larger mitochondrial 66S or 70S units. Under conditions of ethanol-stress in rats the larger subunit is largely dissociated into its smaller components. In E. coli, in the absence of the enzyme pseudouridine synthase (RluD) synthase, there is an accumulation of 50S and 30S subunits and the appearance of abnormal particles (62S and 39S), with concomitant loss of 70S ribosomes.	109

The N-terminal domain, which binds to 5S rRNA, is contained in family Ribosomal_L25p, pfam01386. Full length (N- and C-terminal domain) homologs of TL5 are also known as CTC proteins. TL5 or CTC are not found in Eukarya or Archaea. In some Bacteria, including E. coli, this ribosomal subunit occurs as a single domain protein (named Ribosomal subunit L25), where the only domain is homologous to TL5 N-terminal domain (hence included in family pfam01386). The function of the C-terminal domain of TLC is at present unknown.	84
58055	406004	pfam15433	MRP-S31	Mitochondrial 28S ribosomal protein S31. MRP-S31 is the mitochondrial 28S ribosomal subunit S31. This family of proteins is found in eukaryotes.

60073	407518	pfam17487	RPS12	Ribosomal protein S12. This is a family of unknown function. Family members are ribosomal proteins found in the mitochondria (RPS12). Homologus RPS12 proteins in bacterial ribosoms participate in stabilizing the second base pair of the codon-anticodon duplex in the A site and is likely to be critical for the fidelity of decoding process. A similar role can be anticipated for this protein in mitochondrial ribosomes. This has been shown where the product of edited RPS12 mRNA translation represented a component of the mitoribosome's small subunit.	87

Arabidopsis microrchidia (MORC) ATPase family proteins are conserved among plants and animals and are involved in transcriptional silencing. In Arabidopsis, MORC6/DMS11 was reported to function in the condensation of pericentromeric heterochromatin, thereby facilitating transcriptional silencing. Further studies demonstrate that MORC6 and its homologs MORC1 and MORC2 form a complex which associates with SUVH9, required for Pol V occupancy in the RdDM (RNA-directed DNA methylation) pathway.	139
